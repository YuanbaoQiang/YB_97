# Why LaTex

Just because I like something new, I like challenges, and also not afraid of  trouble. Windows, a system most people use, while has been replaced with Linux platform by me few days ago. At least I feel pretty better now~ 

Word, a component of Microsoft Office, like win, has been packaged well. Until I met LATEX, also a new Editing method for me, and a new idea appeared: I want to try. In fact, I did learn a lot about typography from it, which you can’t feel with word. I hope i can use it to complete my first paper.
